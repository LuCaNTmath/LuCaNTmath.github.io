<p>The proceedings of the first conference on LMFDB, Computation, and Number Theory (LuCaNT) will be published in an open access volume of <a href="https://www.ams.org/books/conm/">Contemporary Mathematics</a>. We encourage anyone with research related to mathematical databases or computation to submit a paper. The suggested length for papers is no more than 20-25 pages, excluding references. However, longer papers will also be considered.</p>

<p>Papers will go through a peer review process. In addition, any developed code should be placed in a publicly available repository such as GitHub to be available to the reviewers (to help improve the quality, accessibility, re-usability, and reproducibility of the code and data).</p>

<p>It is not required that an accepted paper be presented at the conference but from among the accepted papers a select list of speakers will be invited to give talks at the first <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/events/sc-23-lucant/">LuCaNT conference</a>, which will take place at ICERM, July 10-14, 2023.</p>

<p>The deadline for submissions is <b>January 10, 2023</b>. We anticipate final decisions by May 2023.</p>
