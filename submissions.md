The proceedings of the first conference on LMFDB, Computation, and Number Theory (LuCaNT) will be published in an open access volume of [Contemporary Mathematics](https://www.ams.org/books/conm/). We encourage anyone with research related to mathematical databases or computation to submit a paper. The suggested length for papers is no more than 20-25 pages, excluding references. However, longer papers will also be considered.

Papers will go through a peer review process. In addition, any developed code should be placed in a publicly available repository such as GitHub to be available to the reviewers (to help improve the quality, accessibility, re-usability, and reproducibility of the code and data).

It is not required that an accepted paper be presented at the conference but from among the accepted papers a select list of speakers will be invited to give talks at the first [LuCaNT conference](https://icerm.brown.edu/events/sc-23-lucant/), which will take place at ICERM, July 10-14, 2023.

The deadline for submissions is January 10, 2023. We anticipate final decisions by May 2023.

A link to the submission website will be posted here as soon as it becomes available and no later than December 1, 2022.
